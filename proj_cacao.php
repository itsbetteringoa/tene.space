                <h2>Cacao experiments</h2>
                <hr class="star-primary">    

                <p>
                  i liked to drink cacao and ate chocolates since childhood. and during whole my life i'm having it more or less. but since 2014 i realized that i'm kinda passionate about cacao and while i did travelling around South Asia i especially tried different types of cacao products to find out about quality and taste.
                </p>
                <p>
                  suddenly in 2015 i was at one indonesian island and surprisengly i discover a lots of cacao trees and pods there! that was amazing breakthrough. so i got some beans to <b>make first chocolate product by my own hands</b>
                  .
                </p>
                <p>
                  ohhh guys, that was the second really stunning unforgettable expirience in my life after <b>Salvia</b>
                  ! so than i decide to find out the way to deal with cacao beans directly and made my own experiments with it
                </p>
                <p>
                  in 2016 in <abbr title = "see the map below">sulya, karnataka, india</abbr>
                  i was lucky to get in touch with local farmer who is growing cacao trees. since that time already i got around <u>100kg (2 batches) of pure raw wet cacao beans</u>
                  and prepared it in Arambol, Goa
                </p>
                <p>
                  most of them was given as part of mine <abbr title="literally it's an Act of giving free food (mostly raw vegetables and fruits)&#013; on the Arambol's beach (Goa, India) during sunset time.&#013; was done around 80 times">"sunset-missions"</abbr>
                  and distributed for
                  <b>donations</b>
                  + sended to friends in Russia
                  <br/>    
                </p>
                <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
                  <h4>Cacao for DONATIONS</h4>
                        <a class="fancybox-thumbs" data-imagelightbox="c12" href="img/cacao_infographic.jpg">
                          <img src="img/cacao_infographic_800.jpg"  alt="cacao for donations" title="cacao for donations" class="img-responsive"></a>
                  <p>
                    it was
                    <b>pure experiment</b>
                    for me &mdash; just to check how ready is the people to make benefactions. i guess, totally around <u>25 times</u>
                    i distributed cacao-products at Arambol beach. and asked for donations only 2-3 times. most of the times people just took it and day-by-day started to give some money.
                    <br/>    
                    <b>so finally i got
                      <span class = "badge red">~5500 Rs</span>
                      of donations!</b> 
                    which is very very good start and it means that i nearly cover expenses for beans itself
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    also some people want to BUY cacao-beans and i keep telling them, that with this cacao i want:
                  </p>
                  <div class = "alert alert-success">to give and share rather than to sale and deal</div>
                  <p>
                    but of course you can get beans for money also if you don't know any better way to THANK. i understand, that for some people it's easier and habitual.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    that's why i'm trying to maximize transparency so everybody could see what is the
                    <b>real price</b>
                    and how it comes from
                    <div class="p_10"></div>
                    Here is some calculation which make sense:
                    <br/>    
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; 1kg of raw beans from farmer
                    <span class = "badge">~62 Rs/kg</span>
                    . one batch is
                    <u>~50kg</u>
                    &rarr;
                    <span class = "badge">~3100 Rs</span>
                    <br/>    
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; transportation the batch from farmers place to goa (one way)
                    <span class = "badge">~500 Rs</span>
                    <br/>    
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; drying beans costs
                    <span class = "badge">0 Rs</span>
                    (1kg of raw beans &rarr; ~0.3kg of dry beans). so from batch we can get upto
                    <u>18kg</u>
                    of dry beans
                    <br/>    
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; roasting costs
                    <span class = "badge">~300 Rs</span>
                    per batch. it's included only charcoals and kerosene
                    <br/>    
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; cleaning from nibs costs

                    <br/>

                    <span class = "badge">0 Rs</span>
                    <br/>    
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; extra ingridients costs are very depends on stuff (fruits, olive oil, fullcream, honey, raisins etc). but i would say
                    <span class = "badge">~1200 Rs</span>
                    per batch
                    <br/>    
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; using other facilities like cooking-gas or electricity is nearly 0 Rs till now. but for serious production it will be i guess
                    <span class = "badge">~200 Rs</span>
                    per batch/month

                        longer is better for reduce bitterness, which is essential cuz those type of cacao (Forastero) is very avarage.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        fermentation is also about reducing bitterness and make taste more mild, but i didn't make it yet

                        . it's also like "roasting ceremony" wich gathered few people few times. afterwards we use same charcoals to roasting cashew or preparing tea

                        TASTING &mdash; i like to eat roasted beans a lot! especially i did a very darkly roasting (on the edge of burning) so the taste becames very rough & tough. it have very very
                        <u>intense</u>
                        taste (cuz it's around 95% of pure cacao, guys!) and you couldn't have it more than one/two tea-spoons at the time. also it's a good energetic and hunger-killer

                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; usually it becames as crumbly/crunchy wet mass, which is melting in normal warm temperature and drying out very quickly (became more crumbly)

                        this device i did order from one tinsmith at Mysore's hardware market. it was nearly impossible to get one, cuz only few people would understand what i'm asking about. so nowday only electrical/gas roasters in stock.

                      <p>
                        CONSTRUCTION &mdash; cylinder with handle and few holes on both sides. there is a hatch where you will load beans (capacity is ~1kg). and the rest is a barbeque grill with section for charcoals
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        OPERATING &mdash; just load beans in cylinder and heat charcoal in underneath section. slowly spining until smell and crackling will start coming out. also you can notice the readyness by color of beans itself
                      </p>
                      <p>DISADVANTAGES</p>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; too much time (25-30 minutes)
                      <br/>    
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; too little capacity for mass production
                      <br/>    
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; no standart formula to prepare it exactly the same as before, cuz you couldn't rely on charcoals and you couldn't count "proper" rotation per minute
                      <br/>    
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; it takes all your attention and you couldn't do anything else during roasting
                      <br/>    
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; without any special coatings it starts rusting very very quickly
                      <br/>    
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; this particular construction has no "curtains" to prevent blowing-up heat from charcoals. it means if there is good wind, the charcoals will lasting very short time and most of the heat will blow away
                      <div class="p_10"></div>
                      <p>ADVANTAGES</p>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; it's nice time spending process and it's kinda "magical" ceremony which could gather people
                      <br/>    
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; you still can adjust the readyness by opening hatch and checking bean-by-bean oftenly
                      <br/>    
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; you can use this barbeque stall with grill, charcoal section and cylinder for cooking anything else! like we made tea and roasting cashew nuts! it's very-very handy multi-purposal tool
                      <br/>    
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; it's not rely on electricity, so you can do it
                      <u>anywhere at anytime</u>
                      . and it's not so heavy and not big to carry around

                      <p>
                        i was extremly lucky to found this device suddenly at Mysore's second-hand metal/garbage market. it was full of rust and was looks like rubbish, but i knew it could be very useful and i need to give it to try
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        CONSTRUCTION &mdash; this is like oldschool mincer/grinder with spiral knife and handle (looks nearly the same as russian meat mincer) but on the outcoming part there is special adjustable metal mills, which let you control the size of granules/particles
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        OPERATING &mdash; just load beans in  top section and start rotating the handle. you need to bring some hand-efford to get tough beans grinded. you will feel when it's over and you need to load another portion.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        for first round i adjusting the gap between mills to get bigger granules from beans, and another round i'm making smaller gap to work with roughly grinded mass
                      </p>
                      <p>DISADVANTAGES</p>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; unfortunately this mincer is not suits very good for fatty cacao beans, cuz it still heat them up while doing grinding and that it becames a greasy mass which is stucking inside the output mill. so you still can do it, but need to open it and clean very oftenly, which is not efficient at all
                      <br/>    
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; also you couldn't get unnoticeably smallest particles with this tool again because of fatness of cacao mass and specificity of mill/grinder
                      <br/>    
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; the capacity is very small (~200gramms per time) and also you should clean the tool serveral time + you should make at least 2 round to get smaller particles - so it takes a looooots of time to make some amount of cacao-mass
                      <div class="p_10"></div>
                      <p>ADVANTAGES</p>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; it's good physical excercise for me _) and you can connect handle to b-cycle and spin it with legs as well!
                      <br/>    
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; it's not rely on electricity, so you can carry it around and grind cacao
                      <u>anywhere</u>
                      <br/>    
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; it's also like true interacting with cacao-beans to converting your love, passion and effort to something soulful and tastful. IMHO with electrical machine you could achieve technically right smallest particles, but you couldn't achieve that "connection" with what you are doing
