                                            first time i've visited Goa, India at 2009 and was spend there (mostly at North Goa - Anjuna/Vagator/Siolim) nearly one
                                            <u>stunning /astonishing /marvelous /remarkable year</u>
                                            . from that time i had only nice remeberences of Goa and time spended there.

                                        <p>
                                            second time i returned at november 2015 and spend 3 month at Arambol, North Goa. this is very different place than Anjuna/Vagator/Siolim mostly because of people, which made quite famous sunset-point /drum-circle. it's a huge gathering of anybody who are freely doing what they want and what is not bothering others + many curious tourists. it's lovely /soulful /peaceful /harmonical /inspiring /fascinating athmosphere with kind of Unity sense
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            once i was there and since that time just started coming every single evening because i couldn't imagine any better place to be and time to spend.

And most of the time i could only say back to them 'Thank YOU'. But now i got something else to give. So it's doesn't really matter to whom, but just to Universe, because i believe that we are ONE

But after a while more and more people got involved and i started to recieve some feedbacks (like very positive references, advices, material goods/treats, goodwill to help and helping acts)
